# Knowing that investors are making big moves around Tesla's earnings, I wanted to see how this would affect the model. 
When Elon Musk speaks, I expect fluctuation and high volatility in the following days. The model reflects this with almost identical odds (not probability) of your position being up or down after 7 days.
This makes sense because trading in volatility can be like flipping a coin, 50/50. However, When the date is extended from 7 days to 14 days after earnings, the odds of your position being up are much higher than the odds of being down. This change makes because given time, volatility slows down and investors will begin to invest knowing that tesla is a viable long-term company.
