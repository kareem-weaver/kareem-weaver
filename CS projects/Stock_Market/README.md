## Knowing that investors are making big moves around Tesla's earnings, I wanted to see if the model reflects this. 

* When Elon Musk speaks, I expect fluctuation and high volatility in the following days. The model reflects this with almost identical odds (not probability) of your position being up or down after 7 days. This is congruent with the assumption that trading in volatility is like flipping a coin 50/50.
* However, When the date is extended from 7 days to 14 days after earnings, the odds of your position being up are much higher than the odds of being down. This change makes sense because given time, volatility/FOMO decreases, and investors begin to invest knowing the viability of Tesla as a growth company.
